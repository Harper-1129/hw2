This is a prompt I wrote using ChatGPT.
### Step 1: **Business Understanding**
- Define the goal: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, class, and family relations.

### Step 2: **Data Understanding**
1. Load the Titanic dataset and inspect the structure.
2. Check for missing values and visualize them (e.g., using heatmaps).
3. Explore data distributions and relationships between features and the target variable (`Survived`).

### Step 3: **Data Preparation**
1. **Handle Missing Data**:
   - Fill missing `Age` values with median or other imputation techniques.
   - Fill missing `Embarked` values with the mode.
   - Drop irrelevant or highly incomplete columns like `Cabin`.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Convert categorical features (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) into numeric values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Create new features (e.g., `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`) to capture meaningful relationships.
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Remove unnecessary columns such as `PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket`.
4. **Scaling**:
   - Normalize or scale numerical features to improve model performance.

### Step 4: **Modeling**
1. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
2. Train multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
3. Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.

### Step 5: **Evaluation**
1. Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - ROC-AUC for binary classification.
2. Visualize the results:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Feature importance (for models like Random Forest).
3. Compare different models and select the best one based on performance.

### Step 6: **Deployment**
1. Create a function to preprocess and predict survival for new data.
2. Provide a practical example of predictions for unseen data.

These steps encapsulate a clear, structured workflow to address the Titanic classification problem effectively.
